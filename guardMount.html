    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      To protect my handlebars and controls while dirt biking, I generally use wraparound hand guards. 
      These consist of an aluminum bar that connects to the end of the handlebar, a mount that secures 
      to the inner portion of the handlebar, and a plastic shroud. However, the mounting solutions 
      are often less than ideal — they can be finicky to fit, sometimes requiring shims or bending, 
      since the guards are universal and cannot accommodate every handlebar shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my bike with Renthal Twinwall handlebars, the common style bar mounts are incompatible 
      due to the tapered design at the clamping area and interference from the factory crossbar mounts.
    </p>
    

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>
      To solve this, I designed a custom aluminum component that integrates the crossbar mount 
      with the wraparound hand guard mount. Essentially, I created a stronger crossbar mount 
      that copies the original geometry but includes a threaded hole extending outward to connect 
      the hand guards.

    <p>
      The mount was designed as a two-piece construction so it can be removed without completely 
      disassembly of the dirt bike controls. Since wraparound guards protect controls during 
      crashes or tip-overs, the mount needed to be strong enough not to become the weak link.

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p>
      I machined the mounts from a 1” thick 6061 aluminum plate. The two blanks were cut 
      from the plate using a water jet, and then finished to the desired dimension on a milling machine. 
      This produced a strong, precise part capable of withstanding the impacts expected in use.
