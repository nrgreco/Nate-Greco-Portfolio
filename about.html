    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a concentration in Manufacturing. 
        I have a passion for design, machining, and hands-on engineering projects. My interests extend into outdoor 
        engineering-related hobbies such as building custom campers, dirt bike modifications, and exploring overlanding setups.

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve worked as a shop technician, welding supervisor, and painter at the Cal Poly ME machine shops. 
        I’ve also led and contributed to multiple engineering projects such as my senior design custom valve, 
        CNC fixture design, and the full build of a custom slide-in truck camper. These roles have strengthened 
        my technical expertise and problem-solving skills in both academic and personal projects.
